# Circle
Project from Applied Algorithmics/Data structures, algorithms, and discrete math course

Design a class which represents a Circle in the (x,y) coordinate plane.  A Circle object is initialized with three input arguments.  The center of the circle specified as the first two inputs (x,y) and the radius of the circle.  By default the circle will be centered at (0, 0) with a radius of 1.

c = Circle(0, 0, 1)

The Circle class should provide proper getters/setters for the x and y coordinates of the center as well as the radius.  The circle should also have a getArea() and getPerimeter() method.  Finally, the circle should have a method called, isPointWithinCircle(x, y) which takes as augments the x and y coordinate of a point and determines whether the point lies within the circle.  It should return a boolean indicating whether the point is within the circle
